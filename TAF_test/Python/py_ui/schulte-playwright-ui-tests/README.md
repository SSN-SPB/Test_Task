# Schulte Playwright UI Tests

This project contains automated UI tests for the Schulte Table application using Playwright and pytest. The tests are organized into a modular structure with Page Objects, Service Functions, Connectors, and a Logger for better maintainability and readability.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd schulte-playwright-ui-tests
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Playwright Browsers:**
   After installing Playwright, you need to install the necessary browsers:
   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
pytest
```

You can also run tests for a specific page by navigating to the corresponding test folder and executing:
```bash
pytest .\tests\<page_name>\test_<page_name>_page.py
```

The default headless mode - true. To run with UI by adding the `--run_without_ui=false` flag:
```bash
pytest .\tests\<page_name>\test_<page_name>_page.py --run_without_ui=false
```
The headless mode is useful for CI/CD pipelines or when you don't need to see the browser UI. It is default for this project.

You can select browser by adding the `--browser_type` flag:
```bash
pytest .\tests\<page_name>\test_<page_name>_page.py --browser_type=firefox
```
Allowed values: ["chromium", "firefox", "webkit"] The default browser is Chromium.

### Run in parallel

#### Install library
```bash
python -m pip install pytest-xdist
```

#### Run in parallel
```bash
pytest -n 2	Run using 2 worker processes
pytest -n 4	Run using 4 worker processes
pytest -n auto	Choose worker count automatically
pytest -n 0	Explicitly disable xdist
```

####Measure Powershell
```bash
Measure-Command { pytest }
Measure-Command { pytest -n 2 }
Measure-Command { pytest -n 4 }
Measure-Command { pytest -n 4 --dist loadscope }
```


## Allure Reporting

Test results are automatically saved to the `allure-results/` directory. To view the report:

1. **Install Allure CLI** (if not already installed):
   - **Windows (Scoop):** `scoop install allure`
   - **Windows (npm):** `npm install -g allure-commandline`
   - **macOS (Homebrew):** `brew install allure`
   - **Linux:** Download from [Allure releases](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2/releases)

2. **Generate and open the report:**
   ```bash
   allure serve allure-results
   ```

   Or generate a static report:
   ```bash
   allure generate allure-results -o allure-report --clean
   allure open allure-report
   ```

The report includes:
- Test results grouped by **Feature** (Schulte Table) and **Story** (grid size)
- Human-readable test titles
- **Screenshots attached automatically on test failure**

## Project Components

- **Connectors:** Manages browser and site connections.
- **Logger:** Provides logging functionality for tracking test execution.
- **Page Objects:** Represents different pages of the application, encapsulating the interactions with those pages.
- **Service Functions:** Contains reusable functions for navigation and validation across different pages.
- **Tests:** Contains the actual test cases organized by page.
